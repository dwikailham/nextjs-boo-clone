### Time Spent

Start: 2025-11-25 — 08:00
End: 2025-11-25 — 11:45
Total: +-3.5 hours

Breakdown:

- Project setup – 20 min
- Layout + UI cloning – 1h 45m
- hover animation + styling – 1h
- Cleanup + README – 25 min

---

Completed:

- Next.js project setup (Page Router + Tailwind)
- Boo-style card UI (avatar, tags, icons, content)
- Hover animations using Tailwind
- Responsive design
- Clean component structure

---

Skipped (Due to Time)

- Multiple cards list
- API integration / fetching data
- Interaction logic (likes, replies)
- Light/dark theme switching
- Entrance animation (scroll reveal)
- Section `Related Post`
- Glow effect / Shadow Effect

---

If I Had More Time, I Would Improve:

- More accurate Boo glow animation
- Create more reusable Card components
- Improve accessibility (ARIA roles, keyboard nav)
- Write unit tests using React Testing Library
- Add skeleton loaders
